# tutorialExplorer

TutorialExplorer is a php App, that shows tutorial-Video-Files in the vids-Folder.

The folder structure should be organized like this:

/path/to/TutorialExplorer/vids/Category/Tutorial/Section/Videofile.mp4

currently there are only mp4-Files supported, all other Files will be available as download.
When a video ends the next video will be played automatically.
